      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4">One of the most well-established benefits of HBOT is its ability to dramatically accelerate wound healing. This is particularly beneficial for:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Diabetic foot ulcers</li>
        <li>Radiation injuries</li>
        <li>Burn wounds</li>
        <li>Skin grafts and flaps</li>
        <li>Chronic non-healing wounds</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">HBOT promotes wound healing through several mechanisms:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Increased Oxygen Supply:</strong> The pressurized, oxygen-rich environment of the hyperbaric chamber allows your blood to carry more oxygen to wound sites, providing the essential fuel for cellular repair.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Collagen Production:</strong> Oxygen plays a crucial role in collagen synthesis, a key component in wound healing. HBOT stimulates increased collagen production, leading to faster and stronger wound closure.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Angiogenesis:</strong> HBOT promotes the formation of new blood vessels, improving blood supply to wounded areas and accelerating the healing process.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Inflammation:</strong> By reducing inflammation in and around wound sites, HBOT helps to create an optimal environment for healing.</li>
        <li><strong>Bacterial Control:</strong> The high-oxygen environment created by HBOT is hostile to many types of bacteria, particularly anaerobic organisms, helping to prevent and combat infections in wounds.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="enhanced-circulation" class="mb-12">

        <a href={benefits[1].link} class="text-primary hover:underline">{benefits[1].title}</a>
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4">HBOT offers significant benefits for your circulatory system and overall cardiovascular health. Here's how HBOT can improve circulation:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Vasodilation:</strong> HBOT promotes the dilation of blood vessels, allowing for improved blood flow throughout the body.</li>
        <li><strong>Neovascularization:</strong> The therapy stimulates the formation of new blood vessels, particularly in areas with poor circulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Blood Viscosity:</strong> HBOT can help decrease the thickness of blood, allowing it to flow more easily through blood vessels.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Oxygen Delivery:</strong> By increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, HBOT ensures that tissues throughout the body receive optimal oxygen supply.</li>
      </ul>
