      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">What is Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) is a medical treatment that involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized environment. This process allows your body to absorb significantly more oxygen than it would under normal conditions, promoting healing and offering numerous health benefits.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">During an HBOT session, you'll relax in a comfortable, pressurized chamber while breathing 100% pure oxygen. This increased pressure allows your blood to carry more oxygen to organs and tissues throughout your body, stimulating the release of growth factors and stem cells, which promote healing.</p>
