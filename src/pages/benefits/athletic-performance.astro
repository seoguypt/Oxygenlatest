      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Increased Oxygen Delivery:</strong> HBOT dramatically increases the amount of oxygen delivered to muscles and other tissues, providing more fuel for energy production and performance.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Enhanced Mitochondrial Function:</strong> The increased oxygen supply can improve the efficiency of mitochondria, the cellular powerhouses, leading to better energy production and endurance.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Reduced Inflammation:</strong> HBOT's anti-inflammatory effects can help reduce exercise-induced inflammation, potentially improving recovery times and reducing soreness.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Accelerated Healing:</strong> By boosting oxygen levels in tissues, HBOT can speed up the healing process for sports injuries, getting athletes back in the game faster.</li>
