      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">HBOT: Oxygen for Your Brain</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) is emerging as a powerful tool for enhancing brain health and cognitive function. By delivering high concentrations of oxygen to the brain in a pressurized environment, HBOT can stimulate neuroplasticity, improve memory, and boost overall mental performance.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">How HBOT Enhances Brain Health</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Increased Oxygen Supply:</strong> HBOT dramatically increases the amount of oxygen delivered to brain tissues, providing essential fuel for cellular repair and function.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Enhanced Neuroplasticity:</strong> The increased oxygen levels can stimulate the formation of new neural connections, potentially improving cognitive function and aiding in recovery from brain injuries.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Reduced Inflammation:</strong> HBOT's anti-inflammatory effects can help protect brain cells and support overall brain health.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Improved Mitochondrial Function:</strong> By enhancing the function of mitochondria in brain cells, HBOT can boost energy production and cellular health in the brain.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Enhanced Cerebral Blood Flow:</strong> HBOT can improve blood flow to the brain, ensuring better delivery of oxygen and nutrients to brain tissues.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Cognitive Benefits of HBOT</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Improved Memory:</strong> Many individuals report enhanced short-term and long-term memory after HBOT treatments.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Enhanced Focus and Concentration:</strong> HBOT may help improve attention span and concentration abilities.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Faster Processing Speed:</strong> Some studies suggest that HBOT can enhance cognitive processing speed.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Better Problem-Solving Skills:</strong> Improved brain function may lead to enhanced problem-solving abilities.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Mood Regulation:</strong> HBOT may have positive effects on mood and emotional regulation.</li>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">HBOT for Neurological Conditions</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">HBOT is being studied for its potential benefits in various neurological conditions:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI):</strong> HBOT may help improve cognitive function and quality of life in TBI patients.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Stroke Recovery:</strong> Some studies suggest HBOT can enhance recovery and improve function in stroke survivors.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Alzheimer's Disease:</strong> Early research indicates potential benefits of HBOT in slowing cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Post-Concussion Syndrome:</strong> HBOT may help alleviate symptoms and improve cognitive function in individuals with lingering concussion effects.</li>
