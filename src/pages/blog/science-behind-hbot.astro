      <p>Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) has gained significant attention in recent years for its potential to treat a wide range of medical conditions. But what exactly happens in the body during an HBOT session? In this article, we'll explore the fascinating science behind this innovative treatment.</p>

      <h2>The Basics of HBOT</h2>
      <p>At its core, HBOT involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized environment. This combination of high oxygen concentration and increased atmospheric pressure leads to a dramatic increase in the amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood plasma.</p>

      <h2>Increased Oxygen Saturation</h2>
      <p>Under normal conditions, oxygen is primarily carried by red blood cells. However, during HBOT, the amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood plasma can increase by up to 2000%. This allows oxygen to reach areas of the body where circulation is diminished or blocked, promoting healing and fighting infection.</p>

      <h2>Stimulation of Angiogenesis</h2>
      <p>HBOT stimulates the formation of new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. This is particularly beneficial in wound healing and in treating conditions where blood supply is compromised.</p>

      <h2>Reduction of Inflammation</h2>
      <p>The anti-inflammatory effects of HBOT are well-documented. By reducing inflammation, HBOT can help in managing a variety of conditions, from sports injuries to chronic inflammatory diseases.</p>

      <h2>Enhanced White Blood Cell Activity</h2>
      <p>HBOT can boost the activity of white blood cells, enhancing the body's ability to fight infections. This is particularly useful in treating conditions like chronic wounds and necrotizing infections.</p>

      <h2>Stem Cell Mobilization</h2>
      <p>Recent research has shown that HBOT can stimulate the release of stem cells from bone marrow. This could have far-reaching implications for regenerative medicine and the treatment of various degenerative conditions.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The science behind HBOT is complex and multifaceted, with new discoveries being made regularly. As our understanding of this therapy grows, so too does its potential to treat an ever-widening range of conditions. At Oxyzen London, we're committed to staying at the forefront of HBOT research and application, ensuring our patients receive the most effective and up-to-date treatments available.</p>
