const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT)?",
    answer: "Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) is a medical treatment that involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized environment. During an HBOT session, you enter a special chamber where the air pressure is increased to 1.5 to 3 times normal atmospheric pressure. This allows your lungs to gather more oxygen than would be possible breathing pure oxygen at normal air pressure, which can promote healing and fight certain infections."
  },
  {
    question: "How does HBOT work?",
    answer: "HBOT works by increasing the amount of oxygen your blood can carry. Under normal circumstances, red blood cells carry most of the oxygen in your body. However, during HBOT, the increased pressure allows oxygen to dissolve directly into all body fluids, including the fluids of the central nervous system, lymph, and bones. This can promote healing and fight infection in ways that normal oxygen delivery cannot."
  },
  {
    question: "What conditions can be treated with HBOT?",
    answer: "HBOT is used to treat a variety of medical conditions, including: decompression sickness, serious infections, bubbles of air in blood vessels, wounds that won't heal as a result of diabetes or radiation injury, carbon monoxide poisoning, gangrene, skin grafts or flaps at risk of tissue death, and severe anemia. It's also being studied for its potential benefits in conditions like traumatic brain injury, stroke, and certain neurological disorders."
  },
  {
    question: "Is HBOT safe?",
    answer: "When administered by trained professionals in a proper medical setting, HBOT is generally considered safe. However, like any medical treatment, it does carry some risks. These can include temporary nearsightedness, middle ear injuries, sinus problems, and in very rare cases, oxygen toxicity. Our team at Oxyzen London takes all necessary precautions to ensure your safety during treatment."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does an HBOT session last?",
    answer: "A typical HBOT session lasts between 60 to 120 minutes. The exact duration depends on the condition being treated and the treatment protocol prescribed by our medical team. Some conditions may require multiple sessions over a period of days or weeks for optimal results."
  },
  {
    question: "What should I expect during an HBOT session?",
    answer: "During an HBOT session, you'll lie comfortably in a clear acrylic chamber. You can relax, sleep, or watch TV during the treatment. As the chamber is pressurized, you might feel fullness in your ears, similar to what you experience when flying in an airplane. You'll breathe normally throughout the session. After the treatment, the chamber will be slowly depressurized, and you can resume your normal activities."
  },
  {
    question: "How many HBOT sessions will I need?",
    answer: "The number of sessions required varies depending on your condition and how you respond to the therapy. Some acute conditions might require only a few sessions, while chronic conditions might benefit from ongoing treatments. Our medical team will create a personalized treatment plan based on your specific needs and monitor your progress throughout the course of therapy."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any side effects of HBOT?",
    answer: "Most people don't experience any significant side effects from HBOT. Some people may experience ear popping or mild sinus discomfort due to the pressure changes. In rare cases, some people might experience temporary nearsightedness, fatigue, or lightheadedness after treatment. These effects are usually temporary and resolve on their own."
  },
  {
    question: "Can children undergo HBOT?",
    answer: "Yes, children can undergo HBOT. In fact, it's used to treat various conditions in children, including certain types of brain injuries and infections.
